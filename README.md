📊 Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard

A Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard built using Java Spring Boot for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
This project displays live system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network activity, and running processes through a web-based dashboard.
